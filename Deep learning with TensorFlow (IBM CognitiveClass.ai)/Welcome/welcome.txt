Hello, and welcome to “Deep Learning with TensorFlow.”

Throughout the five modules of this course, we’re going to show you how you can use
Google’s open source TensorFlow library for your deep learning applications.

In module 1, after introducing you to the TensorFlow library and walking you through
a “hello, world” example, we’ll go over a few basic machine learning algorithms.
This will include linear regression, and logistic regression.
It will help you to understand the fundamentals of TensorFlow and dataflow graphs.

In module 2, we’ll introduce you to the convolutional neural network, a powerful model
that’s capable of object recognition. Like the brain, it works by passing the inputs
through a sequence of increasingly complex layers.
We’ll explain the convolutional operation in detail and then, we’ll show you how to
build a convolutional net with TensorFlow, in order to recognize handwritten digits.

In module 3, we’ll provide an overview of sequential data and recurrent neural networks,
as well as the long short-term memory model. We’ll also go over the application of these
networks in natural language processing.

In module 4, we’ll introduce you to unsupervised learning.
Our main focus will be on the Restricted Boltzmann Machine, which detects patterns by reconstructing
its input. After creating and training a Restricted Boltzmann
Machine in TensorFlow, we’ll show you how to use it to build a movie recommendation
system.

And, finally, Module 5 will explain the concept of an Autoencoder, an unsupervised learning
model for detecting patterns. The module includes a TensorFlow implementation
of an Autoencoder. There’s a lot to go over, but after completing
this course, you’ll be well on your way to using TensorFlow in your own applications.

Thanks for watching, and we hope you’ll enjoy “Deep Learning with TensorFlow!"
